# defi-domain-lending
Mini front-end + backend wiring for lending against domain-backed tokens.

The on-chain lending logic is intentionally compact. Use it to demonstrate protocol flow:
- Borrower deposits domain SPL tokens as collateral
- Protocol mints loan tokens to borrower (mocked behavior in demo)
